# Welcome to my personal website! 
[ianballard.github.io](https://ianballard.github.io/) is built using the [ianballard/personal-website-starter](https://github.com/iballard95/personal-website-starter) template. 
It's a template repo that is intended to make it very easy for anyone to create a personal website in minutes.

The starter template leverages the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) SSG and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
You simply update markdown content and deploy it. 
Voilà! You have you own site up and running.
