        time: 2016 - Present
        company: Jahnel Group, Schenectady, NY
        details: |
            - Received the "Beast Award" for logging 293 billable hours in a month, single-handedly spearheading a new project with an offshore Indian engineering team. My leadership and value transformed this engagement from only myself on the project into one of the firm's largest accounts with multiple engineering teams that became an unstoppable force through cultivating an environment of empowerment and growth. I led these multiple engineering teams, architectural decisions, code reviews, and significantly improved project deliverability and efficiency.
            - Cultivated a culture of mentorship, and inspiration through personalized monthly 1:1s focused on career development, and daily office hours to help engineers with their current and upcoming work. Consistently facilitated opportunities for engineers to assume tech lead roles in our projects, fostering professional growth and leadership development.
            - Led successful team expansion and recruitment, mentoring new team leads to achieve self-sufficiency within 90 days by clearly communicating expectations of new engineers and teams from day 1, and assessing progress against a comprehensive rubric every 30 days to track progress.
            - Championed a collaborative environment through knowledge-sharing meetings and platforms, and cross-team initiatives to manage technical debt and security vulnerabilities, fostering shared responsibility and understanding as the teams grew.
            - Acted as the principal liaison between engineering and other departments, setting up critical recurring cross-functional meetings with different stakeholders, and aligning project goals with organizational objectives. Consistently aligned business objectives with technical parameters such as cost, time, and quality to meet expectations.
            - Utilized anonymous surveys to gauge and enhance my leadership effectiveness, consistently achieving an overall team satisfaction rating of 9.5/10.
            - Immersed myself in key projects, becoming the subject matter expert and offering strategic guidance. Leveraged AI for swift prototype development where suitable, ensuring a seamless transition from initial concept to production-ready systems, such as multi-region support for non-native solutions like Cognito using SQS and event replication, DynamoDB stream events piped to Kinesis data streams and Firehose, and Lambda for custom transformations to private VPC resources holding sensitive data. Developed auto-generating OpenAPI specs for APIs as deployed, centralized access logging solutions across AWS Lambda log groups, latency-based routing and failover using AWS health checks, new identity and access management solutions in DynamoDB, data validation solutions on endpoints and data persistence events, and custom workflow engines to support the ever-changing landscape of user journeys in our system.
            - Designed and implemented a robust health insurance processing service capable of elegantly handling eligibility requests across various payors. This system allows for detailed configuration of responses, seamless toggling of system components, and efficient error management and retry mechanisms, ensuring a positive user experience without any disruption. Created highly configurable ETL frameworks using AWS EventBridge, Lambda, S3, and event notifications, robust backup strategies for both custom cases like Cognito and Elastic Search, and AWS backups, disaster recovery plans, and asynchronous data migration solutions to migrate records as they are first requested to “lazy-load” migrations, markedly improving system resilience and data integrity.
            - Redesigned release strategies to meet business needs as we scaled to multiple teams. Authored comprehensive plans and guides for the client, including a system refactor to microservices, an updated release process, and a bespoke feature flagging solution. These strategic proposals offered scalable, cost-effective alternatives to off-the-shelf solutions, significantly enhancing operational throughput while retaining high code quality. With the use of ephemeral environments in our CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive QA automation strategies, and feature flags, we maintained impressive DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency: ~3.5 times a day, Change Lead Time: 6 days, Change Failure Rate: <5%, Time to Restore: ~2.5 hours). Implemented a sprint composition strategy for each team, ensuring a balanced investment in new features, system improvements, productivity enhancements, bug fixes, and patches for consistent and efficient progress.
            - Won "War Week MVP" by leading the discovery, planning, and design of solutions for 90% of a key client's top-priority features and issues within a week, demonstrating exceptional ability to deliver under pressure.
